## Study Target / Focus / Purpose
* This study aims to address the ongoing need for more STEM professionals in the current workforce by encouraging a focused interest in information technology at an earlier age.  This study targets students and others that do not necessarily have a formal programming background.

## Description of TAP Program ## 
* The Technology Ambassadors Program is an interactive class focused on service learning. TAP provides the opportunity to build a project using different technologies and collectively deliver it through conferences, student involvement, workshops, and outreach events.

* This study is inspired by the various simple racing games found on gaming websites. Keyboard inputs are traditionally used to interact with the games; however, we took it a step further by implementing the Leap Motion controller.

***
## Methods ##
* Our goal is to introduce our audience to procedural programming through an interactive activity where participants can develop their own simple racing game. Participants will learn basic logical operators and statements, such as if/else and while loops. We use block code to help simplify coding for someone to understand and create more interest in ITEC for students.  Through the interactive drag-and-drop architecture of Scratch, the students will learn how certain algorithms are adopted to create the logic behind a game. At the end of the activity, we hope to ignite a strong curiosity for the computer sciences and demonstrate that everybody is capable of learning how to program. We want to encourage the students to become lifelong STEM learners and begin their STEM journey at an earlier age.

* The two technologies used in this project are the Scratch programming language and Leap Motion. Leap motion is a computer hardware sensor device that supports hand and finger motions as inputs. We use this technology to add functionality to the code and be able to move a car along a track by just moving your hand left and right without touching anything.  

* Scratch is a drag-and-drop programming language developed by MIT, which aims to introduce children to programming and logical problem-solving in an interactive, easily digestible manner. Scratch also provides an online community where users can share interactive media such as stories, games, and animation with people from all over the world.  Scratch is designed and maintained by the Lifelong Kindergarten group at the MIT Media Lab (Scratch, n.d.).
