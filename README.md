## Installation ##
1. Downlaod project from Github Repository
2. Install Leap Motion drivers on host PC
3. Install Scratch Extension Browser Plugin
4. Navigate to ScratchX website and load project
5. Ensure Leap Motion extension is recognized in browser (small green circle in ScratchX interface)
6. Click the green flag to start the game

## Study Target / Focus / Purpose
* This study addresses the ongoing need for more STEM professionals in the current workforce by encouraging a focused interest in information technology at an earlier age.  This study specifically targets students and others that do not necessarily have a formal programming background.

## Description of TAP Program ## 
* The Technology Ambassadors Program is an interactive class focused on service learning. TAP provides the opportunity to build a project using different technologies and collectively deliver it through conferences, student involvement, workshops, and outreach events.

* This study is inspired by the various simple racing games found on gaming websites. Keyboard inputs are traditionally used to interact with the games; however, we took it a step further by implementing the Leap Motion controller. We decided to remove the Leap Motion from our interactive activity in order to facilitate the workshop remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Methods ##
* Our goal is to introduce our audience to procedural programming through an interactive activity where participants can develop their own simple racing game. Participants will learn basic logical operators and statements, such as if/else and while loops. We use block code to help simplify coding for someone to understand and create more interest in ITEC for students.  Through the interactive drag-and-drop architecture of Scratch, the students will learn how certain algorithms are adopted to create the logic behind a game. At the end of the activity, we hope to ignite a strong curiosity for the computer sciences and demonstrate that everybody is capable of learning how to program. We want to encourage the students to become lifelong STEM learners and begin their STEM journey at an earlier age.

* The two technologies used in this project are the Scratch programming language and Leap Motion. Leap motion is a computer hardware sensor device that supports hand and finger motions as inputs. We use this technology to add functionality to the code and be able to move a car along a track by just moving your hand left and right without touching anything.  

* Scratch is a drag-and-drop programming language developed by MIT, which aims to introduce children to programming and logical problem-solving in an interactive, easily digestible manner. Scratch also provides an online community where users can share interactive media such as stories, games, and animation with people from all over the world.  Scratch is designed and maintained by the Lifelong Kindergarten group at the MIT Media Lab (Scratch, n.d.).

## Outreach Activities ##
* **1. Tap Expo - April 28, 2020** *Demonstration the working game to Georgia Gwinnett students and faculty via Zoom. To promote IT field and the TAP program to college students.
* **2. Online Virtual Workshop - April 21, 2020**  *Middle school students to promote IT and STEM careers. 
* **3. Online Virtual Classroom Workshops - April 7 and April 14, 2020**  *Intro to computing and Digital media students to promote IT and STEM careers to non-IT college students. 
* **4.Individual Workshops** *To ignite curiosity and interest in the Technology field by introducing programming concepts to general audiences interactively.
